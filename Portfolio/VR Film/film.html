                <p>One of my earlier videos that I did when I was young into content creation. At the time, I had been doing alot of youtube content until I hit a stopping point in my life. I couldnt bring myself to make content, and needed time to re-adjust due to moving into college. This audio was found on tiktok by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@creatingwonders" target=_blank>Creating Wonders</a> and I used it as a way to make a video on the current state in life. The video shows a character working hard on alot of different things, working within the background to then some day come back to those around them. This was my first VRChat Short Film worked on, and I think shows how much Ive grown from then, to now with other projects.</p>

                <p>This VRChat Short film was made for the submission of a Showcase hosted by Furality - The Furality Showcase. This was one of the bigger projects that I took on as it took over the course of 3 days, all while working on it nonstop to submit it in time. The film showcases the reflection back on a content creator, feeling so out of place despite how far they have come from their past. This is a story of the emotions I have felt along my own journey, feelings of doubt and comparison, but a reminder that if you keep down the path you created, then who will ever know what will lie ahead.</p>

                <p>This video was done for my audio design college class. Within the class we had 3 projects, where each one dealt with adding our own sound design to an animation, with each project requiring and adking for more details. While most of the students found others animations, I ended up making my own films in VR, and adding my design from there. In this film, the character needs to find an idea for their final project, so them and their freind explore the world of VR to obtain ideas, before finally landing on an idea that none of them had thought of before. The playfulness around the whole video made it alot more enjoyable to not only edit but to record as well, making the process and ideas to find different camera angles alot easier.</p>
