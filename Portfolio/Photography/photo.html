            <h2>Experince</h2>
            <p>Photography is something that I picked up within the world of VR. In 2024 I picked up the hobby within a social group that hosted events online. I found that I had a really good eye and all the pictures that were taken and posted before, I found myself questioning and saying that "the photo could be better" or "taken at this different angle". I applied to the team and found out that I had picked up the eye and skill pretty easily. Through there I learned alot under the leadership of <a href="https://astralmelodia.carrd.co">Astral Melodia.</a> Ever since then Ive been improving and even tranfering skills that I have learned through VR Photography into IRL photo shoots or even event pictures. I always make sure to tell a story with photos, editing them or posting them in such a way that it captures that very moment as if we are standing in the stand still scene. Pictures capture everything within a split second, so I always find it important to re-tell the moment as it should. </p>
